To install, you must have VS code installed. From there you can clone the repository located in this readme. Once the application is on your machine, run an npm install to ensure you have all the necessary packages. Then type, node run watch, head to your browser and type in http://localhost:3000 and the application should be fully up and running. For background support, you will need to ensure you have mysql installed, you have a localhost set up.

# Known Issues/Errors

The one main issue is that all comments are shown no matter what the post. There is also an issue when the user tries to update their post or delete their post. The funcitonality of the site works, but when deployed to heroku for some reason it shows an error message, fails to reload the page. HOWEVER, it will still update the post and it will still delete the post, it just displays the wrong message and will therefore faile to reload the page.
